# Clustering-Analysis-of-Pokemon-s-Ability-Status

Are you frustrated trying to deduce stats (HP, Atk, Def, spAtk, spDef and Speed) of new Pokemon generations or even for Pokemon selection strategy in Pokemon International Championships? Because we believe appearance has a significant impact on estimation of Pokemon stats, our machine learning model has decided to identify certain patterns or groups from GameFreak's perspective. For example Wailord, Chansey, and Snorlax usually have high HP, while Pokemon with light armor usually have high Def or spDef.

Based on the strengths and abilities of each Pokemon, the findings of this analysis can help Pokemon players choose and use the best Pokemon for their battles. In addition, this project can offer new and interesting insights for Pokemon fans to learn the traits and skills that each Pokemon has.
